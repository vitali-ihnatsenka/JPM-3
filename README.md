He built Robot Factory that can create one robot every three seconds of one type from the list:
 - flying robot

And send it in one of the cities that doesn't contain robot yet.



Superman trying to fight against Lex Luter - unfortunately Superman is unique person and he have to help by himself.
He flying between cities randomly and destroying robots:
 - Flying between cities required half of second
 - destroying flying robot by laser eye's required half of second
